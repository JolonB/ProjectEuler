# Project Euler

This repository contains code for solving the [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems. The majority of the code will be written in C (but I may move to higher level languages if I feel lazy). I can't guarantee the portability of the C code, as it has only been tested on Ubuntu in WSL.
